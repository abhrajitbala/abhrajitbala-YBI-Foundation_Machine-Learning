                                      -Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor- 
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict sales using a Random Forest Regressor. 
The model is trained on historical sales data, aiming to forecast future sales based on key features such as product attributes, sales channels, and customer behavior. By leveraging the power of ensemble learning, the Random Forest model provides accurate predictions that can assist businesses in decision-making and strategic planning.
The project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. csv
